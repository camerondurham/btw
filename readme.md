# setup

Very much inspired by: https://github.com/octetz/linux-desktop

This is a set of scripts to setup a bare bones graphical environment on an Arch Linux installation.

This is just public so I don't have to configure auth when cloning from github
and **might** break your system if you have anything installed already, or
set anything up in your `~/.config` directory. So this is a warning not to use
this.
